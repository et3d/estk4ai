Assuming everything works, it just needs the very basic package: in our case it is basic Adobe Illustrator. Version doesn't matter much. Just launch Extend Script Tool Kit program, you can hit Win key then typing ESTK if you don't know where it is yet, it has a grey S icon like JS. Once opened: there is a main window and additional ones; it is very classic as an IDE program; You gonna make the magic into the biggest one, where we can type.
